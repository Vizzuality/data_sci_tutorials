    "Most tiled web maps follow certain Google Maps conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tiles are 256x256 pixels\n",
    "- At the outer most zoom level, 0, the entire world can be rendered in a single map tile.\n",
    "- Each zoom level doubles in both dimensions, so a single tile is replaced by 4 tiles when zooming in. \n",
    "- The [Web Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection) projection is used, with latitude limits of around 85 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, MapBox, etc. use the standard known as [Slippy Map Tilenames](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames) or XYZ:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tiles are 256 Ã— 256 pixel PNG files\n",
    "- Each zoom level (z) is a directory, each column (x) is a subdirectory, and each tile (y) in that column is a file\n",
    "- Filename (url) format is `http://.../z/x/y.png`\n",
    "\n",
    "Other standards also exist such as the [Tile Map Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service) or TMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference between XYZ and TMS is a flip in coordinates. TMS has its origin [0,0] at the bottom-left, while the origin for XYZ is located at the top-left.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion between tiles and coordinates has been described [here](https://www.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/) ([source code](https://gist.github.com/maptiler/fddb5ce33ba995d5523de9afdf8ef118#file-globalmaptiles-py)). "
