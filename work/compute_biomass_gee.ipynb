    "## Calculate biomass with GEE JS\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation on how to create a microservice with GE engine. In this specific case it \n",
    "calculates biomass and biomass density paralelly for all admin 2 regions in the GADM table\n",
    "by using the map() function. \n",
    "Firstly start off by importing the gadm table containing admin level geometries and the \n",
    "other 2 tables whrc_carbon and forest_change to help in calculating biomass. \n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var whrc_carbon = ee.ImageCollection(\"projects/wri-datalab/WHRC_CARBON\"),\n",
    "    forest_change = ee.Image(\"projects/wri-datalab/HansenComposite_17\"),\n",
    "    gadm36 = ee.FeatureCollection(\"projects/wri-datalab/gadm36\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "   The function below adds a threshold variable for each entry which helps in storing biomass values \n",
    "    only upwards of a specific threshold (in this case 10)\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var addThreshold = function(feature) {\n",
    "  return feature.set({threshold: 10});\n",
    "};\n",
    "var gadm36 = gadm36.map(addThreshold);\n",
    "```\n",
    "  The function addBiomass() has a threshold parameter and adds biomass and biomassDensity density \n",
    "  properties for all the entries in gadm36 (which consists of admi2 areas). Firstly a mask with tree cover\n",
    "  is created with help of the forest_change data. \n",
    "  The addBiomassSum function gets the biomass_masked property and uses the Reducer function to create \n",
    "  a new attribute called biomass. It does so with the feature.set() function. \n",
    "  Afterwards, the biomassSum attribute is stored in a variable and used to calculate and add a new attribute\n",
    "  called biomassDensity which is the biomassSum divided by the area. Finally the geometry of the features is \n",
    "  deleted by setting it to null because it isn't needed anymore.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  NOTE: feature properties/attributes cannot be printed inside the map() function because it is executed \n",
    "  in paralell on different machines. The code has to be written and trusted that it works or debugged in \n",
    "  a different way.  \n",
    " ```javascript\n",
    "var addBiomass = function(threshold) {\n",
    "  var tree_mask = forest_change.select('tree_' + threshold).gt(0);\n",
    "  var biomass_masked = whrc_carbon.max().multiply(ee.Image.pixelArea().divide(10000)).mask(tree_mask);\n",
    "  //^^create and apply mask\n",
    "  var addBiomassSum = function(feature) {\n",
    "    feature = feature.set({biomass: biomass_masked.reduceRegion({\n",
    "      reducer: ee.Reducer.sum().unweighted(),\n",
    "      geometry: feature.geometry(),\n",
    "      bestEffort: true,\n",
    "      scale:30 }).get('b1')});              //The actual calculated biomass is in the attribute b1\n",
    "    var area = feature.geometry().area().divide(100*100);\n",
    "    var biomassSum = ee.Number(feature.get('biomass'));\n",
    "    feature = feature.set({biomassDensity: biomassSum.divide(area)})\n",
    "                      .setGeometry(null); \n",
    "    return feature; \n",
    "  };\n",
    "  gadm36 = gadm36.map(addBiomassSum); \n",
    "}; \n",
    "addBiomass(10);\n",
    "```\n",
    "The table needs to be exported, and not printed because it is too large to be printed. \n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "//print(gadm36);  //don't print or else it'll cause scaling errors\n",
